Use the Workflow class to manage a web scraping process. Each step could represent a different page or section of a website that needs to be scraped. If a step fails (for example, due to a network error), it could be retried. If a step takes too long, it could be cancelled and an error could be raised

```python
workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_step('scrape_home_page', scrape_home_page, timeout=10, retries=3)
workflow.add_step('scrape_products_page', scrape_products_page, timeout=10, retries=3)
workflow.add_step('scrape_contact_page', scrape_contact_page, timeout=10, retries=3)
asyncio.run(workflow.run())
```

2. Data processing pipeline: Each step could represent a stage in a data processing pipeline (e.g., data cleaning, transformation, model training, model evaluation). If a step fails (for example, due to an error in the data), it could be retried. If a step takes too long, it could be cancelled and an error could be raised.

workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_step('clean_data', clean_data, timeout=60, retries=1)
workflow.add_step('transform_data', transform_data, timeout=60, retries=1)
workflow.add_step('train_model', train_model, timeout=3600, retries=0)
workflow.add_step('evaluate_model', evaluate_model, timeout=60, retries=1)
asyncio.run(workflow.run())

3. Microservices orchestration: If you have a system composed of multiple microservices, you could use the Workflow class to manage the flow of a transaction across multiple services. Each step could represent a call to a different microservice. If a step fails (for example, if a service is temporarily down), it could be retried. If a step takes too long, it could be cancelled and an error could be raised.

workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_step('create_order', create_order, timeout=5, retries=3)
workflow.add_step('process_payment', process_payment, timeout=5, retries=3)
workflow.add_step('update_inventory', update_inventory, timeout=5, retries=3)
workflow.add_step('send_confirmation_email', send_confirmation_email, timeout=5, retries=3)
asyncio.run(workflow.run())

1. Database Operations: In a scenario where you are interacting with a database, you might have steps to connect to the database, perform an operation, and then close the connection. If an error occurs during the operation, you might want to log the error and still ensure the connection is closed. This is where error and exit steps come in handy.

workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_step('connect_to_db', connect_to_db)
workflow.add_step('perform_db_operation', perform_db_operation, timeout=5, retries=3)
workflow.add_error_step('log_error', log_error)
workflow.add_exit_step('close_db_connection', close_db_connection)
asyncio.run(workflow.run())

2. File Processing: Suppose you are reading a file, processing it, and then writing the results to another file. If an error occurs during processing, you might want to log the error and still ensure that all files are properly closed.

workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_step('open_files', open_files)
workflow.add_step('process_file', process_file, timeout=60, retries=1)
workflow.add_error_step('log_error', log_error)
workflow.add_exit_step('close_files', close_files)
asyncio.run(workflow.run())

3. Web Server Requests: When handling a web request, you might have steps to parse the request, process it, and then send a response. If an error occurs during processing, you might want to send an error response and log the error.

workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_step('parse_request', parse_request)
workflow.add_step('process_request', process_request, timeout=5, retries=3)
workflow.add_error_step('send_error_response', send_error_response)
workflow.add_exit_step('log_request', log_request)
asyncio.run(workflow.run())

1. Conditional Steps in User Registration: Suppose you have a user registration process where you need to check if a user is already registered. If the user is registered, you send a message saying they're already registered. If not, you proceed with the registration process.

workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_step('check_user_registration', check_user_registration)
workflow.add_cond_step(
'register_or_notify',
register_user, # This function is called if check_user_registration returns True
notify_already_registered, # This function is called if check_user_registration returns False
)
asyncio.run(workflow.run())

2. Parallel Steps in Data Fetching: Suppose you need to fetch data from multiple APIs and want to do so in parallel to save time. You can use parallel steps for this.

workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_parallel_steps(
'fetch_data',
[fetch_from_api_1, fetch_from_api_2, fetch_from_api_3],
execution_mode=ExecutionMode.THREAD
)
asyncio.run(workflow.run())

Suppose you have a long-running workflow that you want to be able to cancel under certain conditions. You could run the workflow in one asyncio task, and monitor the cancel condition in another task. When the cancel condition is met, you call the cancel method to stop the workflow.

Here's a simplified example:

import asyncio

async def monitor_cancel_condition(workflow): # This is just a placeholder. Replace this with your actual condition.
condition = False
while not condition:
await asyncio.sleep(1) # Check the condition every second. # Update the condition based on your actual cancel criteria.
condition = check_cancel_condition()
workflow.cancel()

async def main():
workflow = Workflow({})
workflow.add_step('long_running_step', long_running_step, timeout=3600) # Run the workflow and the monitor task concurrently.
await asyncio.gather(workflow.run(), monitor_cancel_condition(workflow))

asyncio.run(main())
